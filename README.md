# LoopBack Java SDK

The Loopback Java SDK provides simple API calls that enable your Java (or compatible JVM language) application to access a
[LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback) server instance.  It enables you to interact with your
models and data sources using a comfortable, first-class Java interface instead 
of using the clunky `AsyncHttpClient`, `JSONObject`, and similar interfaces.

This project is based on the Loopback Android SDK, see [LoopBack Android SDK documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Android+SDK).
